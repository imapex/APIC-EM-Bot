# APIC-EM-Bot

The purpose of this sparkbot is to quickly and easily pull in relevant information from APIC-EM. This could be used to help troubleshoot with a group or show how all information from APIC-EM can easily be accessible from an API.

With this implementation I decided to use https://ciscopipeline.io. PIPELINE allows you to create the intelligence behind your sparkbot. You don't need to fuss with Servers, VMs, Containers, hosting, autoscaling, HA, or any of that. All you need to do is upload your code and run.

If you would like to test this sparkbot out you can chat with it at APIC_EM@sparkbot.io
